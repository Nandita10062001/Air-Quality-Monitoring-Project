# Air-Quality-Monitoring-Project
A Case Study on Measuring and Monitoring the Air Quality in Bogota, Colombia. 

### Problem Statement: 
Time-to-time, sensors go down which means at some point there will be no measurements of the air quality available. Developing a system that can make estimates of PM2.5 (Particulate Matter) at a given station, when the sensor is offline as well as an improved estimate of PM2.5 levels in between sensors too accurately would be of great help. 

### This is done by following 4 major phases of an AI framework: 
1. Explore Phase 
2. Design Phase 
3. Implement Phase
4. Evaluation Phase

### Goal: 
Allow citizens of Bogota, Colombia to see improved real-time estimates of PM2.5 concentration at all hours of the day and at all locations of the city.
